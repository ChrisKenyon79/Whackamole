WHACK A MOLE !!!

Best Experiences: choosing the images for hitting was fun. 
There are a LOT of good pictures of Donald Trump and Nicolas Cage out there. 
THe basic setup was easier after 2 weeks of class, and I learned a lot 
by searching for different CSS and JS options. 

Worst Experiences:  as usual, small syntax errors were frequent and I lost
hours every day trying to figure things out without using too much help
from others. 
I spent a lot of time unsuccessfully trying to get animation to function
so the "mole" pictures would rise up and still be available to whack.
