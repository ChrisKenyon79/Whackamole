WHACK A MOLE !!!

Game plays in web browser
uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery



Best Experiences: choosing the images for hitting was fun. 
There are a LOT of good pictures of Donald Trump and Nicolas Cage out there. 
THe basic setup was easier after 2 weeks of class, and I learned a lot 
by searching for different CSS and JS options. 

Worst Experiences:  as usual, small syntax errors were frequent and I lost
hours every day trying to figure things out without using too much help
from others. 
I spent a lot of time unsuccessfully trying to get animation to function
so the "mole" pictures would rise up and still be available to whack. 



with more time: 

1. Figure out the animation of slideup() or slidedown()
2. Create buttons for choosing the picture of the moles (Trump, Nic Cage, etc)
3. Create difficulty levels to compensate for mouse or touchpad or touchscreens
4. Create option for multiple moles to rise up at once, not just speed up a single mole
5. Sound added for clicking correcty or wrong
6. Hall of Fame / High Score
